* What is here

This is a self-contained directory holding configuration to run WCT NF+SP jobs.

One main entry is [[./magnfsp.jsonnet]] which will run a WCT NF+SP job
using [[https://github.com/bnlif/magnify][Magnify]] files as input and output.  The file I/O layer is
defined just in this top-level file.  The rest of the configuration
may be reused as-is for other I/O systems, such as running WCT inside
art/LArSoft.
