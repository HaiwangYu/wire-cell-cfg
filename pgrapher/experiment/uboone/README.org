#+title: Wire-Cell Toolkit Reference Configuration for MicroBooNE 

* Overview

This area provides reference WCT configuration for MicroBooNE-specific
but otherwise generic/unspecified jobs.  The configuration extends the
general reference configuration and may provide a basis or example for
further extension for specific jobs.

Conventions:

 - "main" configuration files intended for consumption by UI are named
   ~wct-*~ for ~wire-cell~ command line consumption and ~wcls-~ for
   consumption by the WC/LS interface module and tool provided by the
   ~larwirecell~ package.

 - the remainder of the "main" file name is made up as an abbreviation
   for the top level pipeline.
